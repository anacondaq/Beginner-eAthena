These cursors are based on the game RagnarokOnline by Gravity Corp.
and Lee Myoungjin. For information on the game, please visit their
website at http://www.ragnarokonline.com

Please support the creators of RagnarokOnline!

I really liked the in-game cursors, so I decided to create a few
mouse cursors based on the game.  Included are both animated and
non-animated cursors intended for Windows based machines.

If you redistribute these cursors, please mention me.  If you use
these cursors in a theme, please let me know where I can get the theme.

These cursors are FREE, please distribute them!

I hope you enjoy them!  If you like them, please send me a message,
a letter, or if you want to make a donation I won't stop you :)
