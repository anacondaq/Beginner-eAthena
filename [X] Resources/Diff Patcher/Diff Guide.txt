Diff Guide

(1)Grab the latest client from here
http://svn6.assembla.com/svn/ClientSide/Diff_Project/kRO/RagexeRE/

(1b) Both the .DIFF and the .RAR
Extract the .rar, and make sure the other file is saved as a .diff

(2)Grab the diff tool here

(3) Open the K3dtDiffpatcher and open your diff file. Usually the corresponding client will be automatically be placed into the diff patcher when you select your diff file.

(4) When you press continue, you will be presented with a screen to place your options. (>>) Means the options that will be used in your client. While (<<) means to remove the options from your client. Once done, click patch and your client will be available now and should have an ending similar to x_RagexeRE_patched. ------------------------------------ ON BY DEFAULT
